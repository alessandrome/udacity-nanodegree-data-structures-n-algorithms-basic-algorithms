The algorithm used is very simple and for each step through the list, value is compared the min and max values found till then.

Time complexity:
    - get_min_max: O(n) => the array is traversed only one and doesn't require to be sorted or other special operations

Space complexity:
    - get_min_max: O(1) => algorithm doesn't require any auxiliary data structure during the process
