This exercise has been based on an exercise made on udacity in this course.

Time complexity:
    - sort_012: O(n) => the sorting function pass through the array only one time mantaining info about the index of the last starting 0s in the array and the first index of final 2s

Space complexity:
    - sort_012: O(1) => The algorithm not required extra data structures to store auxilary data
