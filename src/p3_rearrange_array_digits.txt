Resource about heapsort on Udacity has been used to complete this exercise

Time complexity:
    - rearrange_digits: O(n*log(n)) => The time complexity depends on used order function complexity (heapsort in this case), because to make the two sums a sorted array is needed.
        After the sorting, the sum is made taking

Time complexity:
    - rearrange_digits: O(1) => Auxiliary memory needed is not depending on heapsort and the given array
