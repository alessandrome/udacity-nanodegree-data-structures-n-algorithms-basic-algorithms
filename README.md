# Udacity Nanodegree - Data Structures & Algorithms - Advanced Algorithms

This is the Advanced Algorithms chapter project submitted during the Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree course.

### Project Text & Purpose

"A series of real-world open ended problems which train you to apply suitable data structures and algorithms under different context."

The project require to find and use some basic algorithms to solve problems, like sorting algorithms and [divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) algorithms.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requisites

To run python scripts is necessary have installed Python 3 in your environment. On local system i've used Python 3.6 and 3.7 to develop the different projects.
This project has been developed on the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with python 3
